# quee
quee is a work in progress game engine using SDL2 and Lua

## Building
### Linux
We depend on SDL2 SDL2_image and json-c.

These can be installed on Ubuntu 20.04 with:
```bash
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libjson-c-dev
```
Then build by running make
### Windows
I wrote a bat file that requires Visual Studio 2019. It will get the deps for you.
```bash
.\build.bat
```
### Mac
TBD
